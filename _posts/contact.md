## Contact

The best way to find out about the swimming session is on the [Notts Trans Hub Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/nottstranshub/) but if you do not wish to use facebook it is also possible to email either MxAithne or Notts Trans Hub.

You can email MxAithne directly at [unconventionalintimacy@gmail.com](mailto:unconventionalintimacy@gmail.com?subject=Nottingham Trans Swimming) or you can get in touch via Notts Trans Hub either using their [contact page](https://nottstranshub.wordpress.com/contact-us/) or by email them at [nottstranshub@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:nottstranshub@yahoo.co.uk?subject=Nottingham Trans Swimming Group).

If you have any questions on the day email is the best way to reach MxAithne.
