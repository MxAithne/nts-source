## Details

We attend two [Swim for Fitness sessions](http://gossweb.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/toptask/leisureactivities/fulldetails.asp?ActivityID=6141) a month at [Djanogly Community Leisure Centre](http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/leisure-centres/find-a-leisure-centre/djanogly-community-leisure-centre/). Some months there will be more sessions added if there is demand / requests for them, or if a session needs to be cancelled due to national holidays or clashing with other Trans hub events.

The leisure centre is on Gregory Boulevard ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/8Ng2WuYCEcw)), it is a short walk from The Forest Tram stop ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/66aXgiwNBwF2)). There is a 'virtual tours' of part of the entrance, part of the changing room, the pool and the health suite [available here](http://gossweb.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/virtualtours/djanoglyvtour/start.html) (requires Flash so may not work on all devices).

## Swim for Fitness Sessions

The sessions are lane swimming, so the pool is separated into 3 wide lanes, slow, medium, and fast, to allow people of differing abilities to share the pool. The lanes are wide enough that people swim in circles within their lanes, clockwise (keeping to the left) on the slow and fast (outer) lanes, and anticlockwise (keeping to the right) in the medium (middle) lane.

The depth of the pool is the same throughout, the pool is a modern pool with an adjustable floor. During the sessions we attend the depth is typically 1.5 meters and allows diving, but it may be shallower if the leisure centre do not have sufficient life guards to allow that depth. If the pool is shallower than 1.5 meters diving is not allowed.

When you are not swimming it is fine to wait at the ends of the lanes and socialise. There is often a group of us at one end of the pool talking while we're not swimming.

## When is it?

As some regular attendees have expressed privacy concerns dates and times of the sessions are posted on the [Nottingham Trans Hub facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/nottstranshub/), or emailed to people who do not have access to facebook. Please see facebook or [contact me](/contact) for dates and times of our next session.

We meet in the reception area of the leisure centre 15 minutes before the session is due to start, and normally head into the changing room 5 minutes before to allow enough time to get changed before the session starts.

After the session we will typically be in the reception area until 15 minutes after the session has ended, so that people have people with them while waiting for taxis / lifts etc. There is then usually a group of us who will walk back to the Forest tram stop together.

## How much does it cost?

It costs £5.30 full price, £4.30 for Active Nottingham members and £2.15 for concessions. It’s free for Nottingham residents to join Active Nottingham, you can do this at the reception desk when you turn up.

You will also need a pound coin or trolley token for the lockers in the changing room, new pound coins do work.

## What to wear

The pool allows people to wear any swim suitable clothing that they wish, so swim tops and rash vests are allowed, as are board shorts or other long leg wear designed to be used for swimming. The pool is used by people from a variety of cultures and faiths so there are usually a lot of people wearing more covering swim wear.

Also typically within our group there are also people with visible chest scars, or people who do not pass as their gender, none of this has been a problem.

## Is the session trans, nonbinary, and SOFFA only?

Unfortunately not, there is not currently enough people attending the sessions to get the council to support a full trans only session. The swim for fitness session is an open swim allowing anyone over 16 (or 14 if accompanied by an adult).

Think of it as mutual support for people who otherwise wouldn't feel confident or comfortable swimming alone, or who just want to swim and socialise with other trans and / or nonbinary people.

## Changing Room

The changing room is completely gender neutral, there is a large area with private cubicles and three lockable shower cubicles. The cubicles vary in size from small individual ones, up to family size and accessible changing rooms. For more details about physically accessibility please see [access page](/access).

The changing room has a machine to dry individual pieces of swimming kit, also a section next to the main doors with mirrors and standard full size and full power hair dryers. There's also hair straighteners there but a key is needed from reception to use these, you get the key in exchange for your Membership City card, wrist band or fob as a deposit item that will be returned to you when you return the key. Hair straighteners are for 16 year olds and over only.

There's also a steam room connected to the changing rooms that you'll have free access to if you've paid for the swim.

## Are the toilets segregated by gender?

Unfortunately yes, the only gender segregation in the building is the toilets, but there are gender neutral accessible toilets that is usable by anyone for those who do not wish to use gendered toilets. 

## Is the leisure centre physically accessible?

Yes, it is a modern full accessible council funded building, for more details of the physical accessibility please see [accessibility](/access).
