Djanogly Leisure Centre is a recently built centre that has very good physical access designed in. There's flat access throughout, and accessible toilets and changing cubicles available without the need for a key. There is generally a good amount of space to manoeuvre wheelchairs or walking aids, but sometimes people move the chairs in reception making it tricky, the reception staff are very helpful and will happily clear a path for you.

You are asked to remove or cover outdoor footwear in the changing room, but if that is difficult or not possible for you it is not insisted upon.

There are lockers at several levels, including some that a space underneath them to allow you to get close to the locker with a wheelchair. 

One of the showers is is fitted with a fold down shower seat and a grab rail, although this is not in a cubicle it is in the communal shower area. 

There is no foot bath between the changing rooms and the pool, the leisure centre ask that everyone showers before going in the water. So it is possible to take a regular wheelchair, walking frame, or crutches poolside, although there is a pool chair also available.

Entry to the water is typically via a recessed ladder in the side of the pool, or using the pool chair and hoist assembly. But it is also possible for the pool to be fitted with standard steps or a full hoist with notice. Please contact Djanogly Leisure Centre to arrange this.

## Changing Places

There is a changing places available at the leisure centre, it has everything that you would expect a changing places to have, an overhead tracked hoist, changing bench, and centrally located toilet. It also includes a dual headed shower with both portable shower seat and a fold down one on the wall with dual grab rails. The only unusual thing about the changing places is that the sink is not hight adjustable.

It requires a full length RADAR key to access, there is one available from reception. Reception prefer that you inform them that you are using the changing spaces as there is only one so there will sometimes be a wait to use it.
