Nottingham Trans Swimming is a twice monthly swimming group for trans and / or nonbinary people and their friends who might not otherwise feel comfortable going swimming by themselves, or just want to swim and socialise with other trans and / or nonbinary people. We go to the [Swim for Fitness]() session at [Djanogly Lesure Centre Nottingham]() and while we do not have exclusive use of the pool we have so far not had an issues. 

For more information about the Djanogly Leisure Centre or the sessions please see the [full details](/details), for information about disability access people see the [accessibility details](/access).
